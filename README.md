## Buildkite Elastic CI Stack for AWS

[Buildkite](https://buildkite.com/) is a platform for running fast, secure, and scalable continuous integration pipelines on your own infrastructure.

The Buildkite Elastic CI Stack gives you a private, autoscaling [Buildkite Agent](https://buildkite.com/docs/agent) cluster. Use it to parallelize legacy tests across hundreds of nodes, run tests and deployments for all your Linux-based services and apps, or run AWS ops tasks.

## Getting started

See the [Elastic CI Stack for AWS tutorial](https://buildkite.com/docs/guides/elastic-ci-stack-aws) for a step-by-step guide, and the [Elastic CI Stack for AWS documentation](https://buildkite.com/docs/agent/v3/elastic-ci-aws) for detailed information. 

Or jump straight in:

[![Launch AWS Stack](https://cdn.rawgit.com/buildkite/cloudformation-launch-stack-button-svg/master/launch-stack.svg)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home#/stacks/new?stackName=buildkite&templateURL=https://s3.amazonaws.com/buildkite-aws-stack/latest/aws-stack.yml)

The current release is ![](https://img.shields.io/github/release/buildkite/elastic-ci-stack-for-aws.svg). See [Releases](https://github.com/buildkite/elastic-ci-stack-for-aws/releases) for older releases.

> Although the stack creates its own VPC by default, we highly recommend following best practice by setting up a separate development AWS account and using role switching and consolidated billing â€” see the [Delegate Access Across AWS Accounts tutorial](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_cross-account-with-roles.html) for more information.

If you want to use the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/), download [`config.json.example`](config.json.example), rename it to `config.json`, and then run the below command:

```bash
aws cloudformation create-stack \
  --output text \
  --stack-name buildkite \
  --template-url "https://s3.amazonaws.com/buildkite-aws-stack/latest/aws-stack.yml" \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM \
  --parameters "$(cat config.json)"
```

## Security

This repository hasn't been reviewed by security researchers so exercise caution and careful thought with what credentials you make available to your builds.

Anyone with commit access to your codebase (including third-party pull-requests if you've enabled them in Buildkite) will have access to your secrets bucket files.

Also keep in mind the EC2 HTTP metadata server is available from within builds, which means builds act with the same IAM permissions as the instance.

## Development

To get started with customizing your own stack, or contributing fixes and features:

```bash
# Checkout all submodules
git submodule update --init --recursive

# Build all AMIs and render a cloud formation template - this requires AWS credentials (in the ENV)
# to build an AMI with packer
make build

# To create a new stack on AWS using the local template
make create-stack

# You can use any of the AWS* environment variables that the aws-cli supports
AWS_PROFILE="some-profile" make create-stack

# You can also use aws-vault or similar
aws-vault exec some-profile -- make create-stack
```

If you need to build your own AMI (because you've changed something in the `packer` directory), run:

```bash
make packer
```

## Questions and support

Feel free to drop an email to support@buildkite.com with questions. It helps us if you can provide the following details:

```
# List your stack parameters
aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name MY_STACK_NAME \
  --query 'Stacks[].Parameters[].[ParameterKey,ParameterValue]' --output table
```

Provide us with logs from CloudWatch Logs:

```
/buildkite/elastic-stack/{instance-id}
/buildkite/systemd/{instance-id}
```

You can also drop by `#aws-stack` and `#aws` channels in [Buildkite Community Slack](https://chat.buildkite.com/) and ask your question!
